# JWT Example

## About

This code is a demo for implementing JWT authentication using access and refresh tokens with Node, Express, React/Redux, and Sequelize (PostgreSQL)

## Start

You will need to create a PostgreSQL database named jwt-example locally. To install all dependencies, use npm install.

Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!

- start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
